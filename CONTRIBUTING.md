# Contributing

Keeping this simple. To contribute,
1. Create an issue with the feature request/bug or ask to be assigned one of the existing issues.
2. Create a new branch from develop and make all your changes in that branch.
3. Ask to be merged into develop, adding either [@Mayank12899](https://github.com/Mayank12899) as reviewer.

Lets do some deployments :)
